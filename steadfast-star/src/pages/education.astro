              <h2><strong>Why children should learn about the weather </strong></h2>
              <p>Teaching children about the  weather and climate can contribute to their development and environmental stewardship as they learn about the relationship with changing weather patterns and the effects of global warming. <br> </p>

               <p><strong> Building Scientific Curiosity</strong></p>
                Introducing children to weather and climate ignites their natural curiosity about the world around them. They will build on the scientific skills of observation,  questioning, and  foster their scientific thinking and problem-solving skills. This early exposure can lay the foundation for future interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). <br> 
                
                Weather and climate discussions also offer opportunities for critical thinking and analysis. Kids can explore the causes and effects of weather phenomena, helping them develop analytical skills and the ability to assess information critically.</p>
