I have always had an interest in technology and how it can be used in Education to benefit students learning outcomes. Last year I began a course with UCD's Professional Academy called Front End Web Development. As part of my final assignment I had to design a website incorporating all the skills I had learned over the course. </p> <p class="lead" > In thinking about what would be the focus of my website I thought about how interested my students are in places all over the world.They love learning about new places and so I  decided to create a resource for primary school students to research the weather of different cities around the world.This website provides information in three hour long blocks on the weather check page.</p>On my education page I have created a resouces of a bank of ideas for teachers of activites and links using this website  that could be used to connect to other curricular areas.

          I would love to hear how students are using this website so please send me a message on how "Check the weather" is being used in your classroom.</p>  </div>
